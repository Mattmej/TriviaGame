# TriviaGame
By Matt Mejia

**This project showcases the use of functions and timers to make a quiz game.**

How much do *you* know about Pokemon types? Take this quiz to find out!
* Select one of the answer buttons to answer the question.
* The user is given 20 seconds to answer each question.
* If the time runs out, then the question is counted as incorrectly answered.
* The user may skip a question by pressing the "skip" button, but the question will be counted as "skipped."
* At the end of the quiz, the number of correct, incorrect, and skipped questions will be displayed.
